# CMP SCI 5020 Android Apps: Android Fundamentals, Spring 2018 Project 4 'Final App'

## Guidelines

For this project, students should design their own app by including a combination of items selected from a list of content options. For the full list of content options, please see the[Project 4](https://github.com/hommg/SeeFoodAndroid/Project_4.pdf) pdf.

## Initial Proposal
"
I will be writing an android translation of an app based on the SeeFood (hotdog/not a hotdog) app from a running gag in season 4 of Silicon Valley. An IOS attempt at this from UMSLHack 2018 can be found [here](https://github.com/hommg/SeeFood).

The app will contain the following:

-RecyclerView Activity where users can enter text for food keywords or choose/take pictures to be used to generate keywords.

-RecyclerView Activity where the results of submitting a query containing the ingredient keywords to a recipes database will be displayed. If the user taps on an item, the recipe will be displayed in greater detail.

Projected Point Breakdown:

    Actvities: 2 pts
    SQLITE: 4 pts
    Data Structures: 3 pts
    ASync Handler: 4 pts
    Animations (Vector Drawable etc): 6 pts
    RecyclerView Holder/Adapter: 6 pts
    Fragment/Screen layouts: At least 2 pts
    Projected Minimum Total: 27 pts
